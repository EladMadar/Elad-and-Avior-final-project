# Statement of Work: Status Page Implementation

## 1. Project Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive status page system to monitor and display the health of customer-facing services, infrastructure components, and system performance metrics.

## 2. Scope of Work

### 2.1 Monitoring Components

#### 2.1.1 Database Monitoring
- Single database instance monitoring
- Metrics:
  - Response times (High priority)
  - Data usage (High priority)
  - Uptime (Medium priority)
  - Overall health (Medium priority)
- 14-day data retention period

#### 2.1.2 Server Monitoring
- EKS cluster monitoring (us-east-1 region)
  - 2 desired nodes
  - 1 minimum node
  - 5 maximum nodes
- Critical metrics:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Load metrics
- Automated alerting system for metric thresholds

#### 2.1.3 Network Monitoring
- External network monitoring only
- Priority metrics:
  - Latency (High priority)
  - Uptime (High priority)
- ALB (Application Load Balancer) monitoring
- No specific SLA targets defined

### 2.2 User Interface

#### 2.2.1 Status Display
- Simple red/yellow/green status indicators
- Detailed metric graphs
- Historical incident timeline
- Customer-facing interface
- Public access to non-sensitive metrics

#### 2.2.2 Admin Panel
- IP-restricted access
- Private metric visibility
- Audit logging for administrative actions
- Maintenance mode functionality

### 2.3 Notification System

#### 2.3.1 Internal Notifications
- Channel: SMS
- Recipients: Operations team and Management
- Immediate alerts for critical issues

#### 2.3.2 Customer Notifications
- Channel: Email
- Opt-in subscription system
- Automated status updates

### 2.4 Incident Management

#### 2.4.1 Incident Tracking
- Predefined severity levels (P1, P2, P3)
- Automated incident creation from alerts
- Comprehensive incident data:
  - Root cause
  - Resolution steps
  - Impact assessment
- 14-day retention period

#### 2.4.2 Maintenance Management
- Planned maintenance scheduling
- 12-24 hour advance notice (based on expected downtime)
- Separate maintenance history tracking
- 6-month maintenance record retention

### 2.5 Security

#### 2.5.1 Access Control
- IP-based restrictions for admin panel
- Clear separation of public/private data
- Audit logging system

#### 2.5.2 Data Management
- Public data accessibility
- Admin-only access for sensitive data
- No external API requirements

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Development Environments
- Development environment
- Staging environment
- Production environment
- All environments to mirror production configuration

### 3.2 Quality Assurance
- Linting implementation
- Unit testing requirements
- No load testing required

### 3.3 Timeline
- Target completion: 1 week
- Full feature rollout (no phased approach)
- Complete testing in dev/staging before production

## 4. Deliverables

### 4.1 Core Features
- Monitoring system implementation
- Status page frontend
- Admin panel
- Notification system
- Incident management system

### 4.2 Documentation
- System architecture documentation
- Administrative guides
- Deployment procedures
- Testing documentation

## 5. Success Criteria
1. All monitoring components functional and accurate
2. Status page accessible and displaying real-time data
3. Notification system delivering alerts through specified channels
4. Admin panel secure and fully functional
5. All environments (dev, staging, prod) properly configured
6. Testing requirements met (linting and unit tests passing)

## 6. Assumptions
1. AWS infrastructure already configured
2. Required access and permissions available
3. SMS and email service providers available
4. No external customer feedback required (personal project)

## 7. Exclusions
1. Internal network monitoring
2. External API integration
3. Load testing
4. Custom data exports
5. External monitoring tool integration
